                <h1>To my First and Last</h1>
                <p>Dear Amanda,</p>
                <p>I hope you liked this website idea. I had such a fun time coding this website just for you, and I wanted it to be a 
                    special gift to show how much you mean to me. This Valentine's Day, I wanted to make sure it's a memorable one, a day 
                that reflects the deep love and appreciation I have for you. Although right now I don't have the money to get you nice gifts,  
            I hope that these small tokens of affection can show you just how much I care. </p>
            <p> Thankyou for always being there for me, especially when I'm at my lowest. Your strong support and belief in me have given 
                me the strength to keep moving forward, even in tough times. I can't even begin to express how grateful I am for that. 
            </p>
            <p> Thankyou for loving me for who I am, flaws and all, and having so much trust in me. Your love has been a constant reminder of
                the incredible person you are, and I promise to never take it for granted. 
            </p>
        <p> I want to take time to apologise for the times I was rude, selfish, arrogant, in denial, or didn't show you the care and respect you
            deserve. I regret the moments I made you cry or hurt you, and I wish I could take back those moments. Please know that I am committed
        to treating you better, each and every day, with all the love and kindness you deserve. </p>
        <p> I also want to express how much you have impacted my faith in God. Your strength, your love, and your unwavering belief have inspired
            me more than words can say. I hope that our faith as a couple continues to grow stronger and stronger each day, rooted in Christ. May our 
            love for each other be unwavering, and may we always turn to God for guidance and strength.
        </p>

        <p>You make me want to be the best version of myself, and I will work every day to make you the happiest person on Earth. I want nothing
            more than to build a beautiful future togehter, and I want you to know that I will keep pushing forward, doing my best to ensure that we 
            have a life filled with love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. 
        </p>
                
                <p>I love you Amanda Yong. Happy Valentine's Day! ðŸ’–</p>
